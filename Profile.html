<SPAN STYLE="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">
<P>I am an IT professional who has been working with 
computers since back in 1983!&nbsp; My first computer was a Sharp PC-1500, then 
we were introduced to Apple 2c's running CP/M and then onto PCs.<BR>
<BR>
I worked in the corporate world for 12 years, but have been on my own for the 
past six years.&nbsp; The range of jobs I have had include being a hardware 
technician building computers at a systems integrator to being a Principal 
Software Engineer at a manufacturer of card personalization machines.&nbsp; And, 
that's just in the computing field.&nbsp; You can view
<A TARGET="_blank" HREF="Documents/Resume_2012012201.pdf">My Resume</A> for 
further details!&nbsp; Other areas of interest have been working in retail, 
construction,  teaching yoga and rock climbing.<BR>
<BR>
I have also had the opportunity to travel a lot since 2002, going 
to India several times, Italy, Thailand and Malaysia.&nbsp; I am also an avid  
rock climber, yogi, and raw vegan (~95% raw on a daily basis).&nbsp; I can provide 
information and instruction in all these areas as well!&nbsp; If you are 
interested in pictures of where I have traveled and rock climbed in recent years, then please check out these links</FONT>:</P>
