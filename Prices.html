<P><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">I charge <STRONG>$30</STRONG> for the first hour 
and <B>$20/hour</B> thereafter for onsite assistance.&nbsp; I am willing to travel anywhere in the local area.&nbsp; Travel costs may apply, and I will let you know 
once I know where you live.</span></P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;"><P> I  can also fix software problems remotely, if I am able to log into your computer. I charge <strong>$10/hour </strong>for this service. You will need to install a small, third-party communications program to this, which allows me to take over your computer remotely.&nbsp; I have had much success with this method.</P>
</SPAN>
<P><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">These are very REASONABLE RATES!&nbsp; I don't believe it 
  is necessary to charge people upwards of $50/hr or more to fix home computers.&nbsp; 
  This does not mean a job will be in the 1-2 hour range, but you will not be 
  paying the [sometimes] $90/hr that local computer businesses charge for home 
  visits.&nbsp; There are some that have a flat rate of $150, just to make a home 
  visit! Because of the millions of ways that a computer or 
  network can be setup, it is hard to tell what the scope of a job will be, so it 
  is hard to give an estimate as to how long it will take.&nbsp; This is not a 
lack of experience, but better than starting off with quoting high prices!</span></P>

<P><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;">I can also assist you via  <A HREF="http://www.Skype.Com" TITLE="Click here to download Skype..." TARGET="_blank">Skype</A>. Meaning, the Skype call is free, but you still have to pay! Please click the <STRONG>Skype </STRONG> link on the left. It will show if I am online or not. You can leave a voicemail as well.</span></P>
